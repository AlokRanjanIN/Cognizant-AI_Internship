# Cognizant -  Artificial Intelligence Project
<a href="https://www.cognizant.com/"><img src=".images/logo.png"></img></a>

This repository contains the analysis conducted during my internship at Cognizant. 

The project aimed to tackle Gala Groceries' supply chain issue by optimizing item stocking to enhance cost efficiency and customer satisfaction by exploring sales data, understanding relational data, building predictive models, and deploying ML algorithms for production.

## Tasks

### [Task 1: Exploring Customer Data](./Task%201_Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/)

Explore Gala Groceries' sales data to identify insights and recommendations for optimizing stock levels.

### [Task 2: Data Modeling](./Task%202_Data%20Modelling/)

Understand relational data and formulate a problem statement for predicting stock levels based on sales and sensor data.

### [Task 3: Model Building and Interpretation](./Task%203_Model%20Building%20and%20Interpretation/)
Develop predictive models using sample data, combining, transforming, and modeling three datasets effectively to address the business problem statement.

### [Task 4: Machine Learning Production](./Task%204_Machine%20Learning%20Production/)
Develop machine learning algorithms for production by preparing a Python module for training models and outputting performance metrics.

### [Task 5: Quality Assurance](./Task%205_Quality%20Assurance/)
Improve the production machine learning model and discuss optimization strategies with the ML engineering team for better performance before integration.
