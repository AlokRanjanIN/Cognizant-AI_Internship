# Cognizant AI Internship - Task 5

## Quality Assurance: Improving Production Machine Learning Model

### Overview

Welcome to Task 5 of the Cognizant AI Internship! üöÄ In this task, we focus on evaluating the production machine learning model to ensure quality results and address questions raised by the ML engineering team to improve the model's performance.

### üîç Task Details

1. **Answering ML Engineering Team's Questions:** Address questions raised by the ML engineering team to identify ways to improve the performance of the machine learning model.

### üìã Task Background

The ML engineering team has deployed the machine learning algorithm into production with the help of DevOps. Before the model goes live, the DevOps team collected predictions from the algorithm and provided them to the ML engineering team for testing against actual results. After testing, the ML engineering team raised questions about the model's performance to further improve it before integration with Gala Groceries‚Äô live system.

### ü§î ML Engineering Team's Questions and Considerations

During the evaluation process, several considerations emerged from discussions with the ML engineering team to address potential improvements in the model's performance and robustness:

1. **Accuracy Evaluation:** Assessing the model's accuracy on live data compared to the training phase to identify any discrepancies and potential causes for performance differences.

2. **Model Complexity:** Exploring the balance between model complexity and interpretability, considering the potential advantages and disadvantages of using more complex algorithms compared to the current model (CatBoost).

3. **Feature Engineering:** Investigating additional datasets provided by the client, such as weather data and delivery schedules, to enhance feature engineering and capture more relevant information for predicting stock levels.

4. **Performance Optimization:** Exploring techniques to optimize the current model's performance, particularly focusing on reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric to improve prediction accuracy.

### Conclusion

Task 5 involves a comprehensive evaluation of the production machine learning model, considering various factors such as model accuracy, complexity, feature engineering, and performance optimization. By addressing the questions and considerations raised by the ML engineering team, we aim to enhance the model's effectiveness and ensure its successful integration into Gala Groceries‚Äô live system.
