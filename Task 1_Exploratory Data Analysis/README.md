# Cognizant AI Internship - Task 1

## Exploring Gala Groceries Customer Data

### Overview

Welcome to Task 1 of the Cognizant AI Internship! üõí This project focuses on exploring customer data from Gala Groceries, a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA. From analyzing transaction times to customer preferences, delve into the depths of sales data to gain insights into customer behavior and optimize stocking strategies.

### üîç Code Overview

#### 1. Data Acquisition

The code imports sales data from Gala Groceries, including transaction IDs, timestamps, product IDs, categories, customer types, unit prices, quantities, total amounts, and payment types.
